# CalculatorIntentWeb-App
This app consists of three main activities: Calculator, Intent, and WebView. 

The Calculator activity includes a self-made calculator that supports the four primary arithmetic operators. 

The Intent activity consists of buttons that trigger various intents, such as SMS, Call, Camera, Share, M-PESA, Dial, and Email. 

The WebView activity simply displays a hardcoded Instagram page. 

Please refer to the screenshots below to observe how the app functions.
